            <h2>Hi, we're Mining for Potatoes, you may remember us from games such as Minecraft, Minecraft and Minecraft...</h2>
            <p>
Thats a lie, you probably have never heard of us... but that doesn't matter. We think thats a good thing–we're just a bunch of friends playing what we want to play with who we want to play. While the aim in the beginning was to play Minecraft, MfP has developed into something more, and we (hopefully) want you to be a part of that...</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>We created Mining for Potatoes about a year ago, but don't let our age fool you. We have members who have played with each other for much longer than that, each with their own quirks and fancies. From the owner, to the mods, to the players, since the beginning, we've aimed to provide the best goddamn server to play, hang out, and just have a blast of a time.</p>

                <i class="fa fa-group fa-2x"></i>
                <h2>Community</h2>
                <p>We love each other. But in the beginning we didn't know each other. Jack was some guy in New Zealand, Nimit was just a random from USA. Hello, DJ was a <s>girl</s> guy from the Netherlands, and it took us a year to work that out! What we cherish is the community of gamers we have built over time. People have come and gone, but what is left is a group of people who talk about just about anything! Except that guy called Dark. Don't trust him. Kidding, or so you think. ;)</p>

                <h2>Specs</h2>
                <p>The server is ran on a VPS with 2GB of allocated DDR3 RAM. It also has a 100mbps up/down internet connection to ensure you get an as-good-as-possible playing (and being awesome) experience.</p>

                <h2>Pictures</h2>
                <p>On MfP we have builders and builds in all shapes and sizes.

Some builds are better than others, but then again, when is that not the case? People tend to build huge and amazing bases for all their storage and farming needs! To your right you see only a handful of memorable experiences that can be found on the server. But we promise you, there is more.</p>

        <div class="rul panel">
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>Even though we are usually very flexible when it comes to what you can and cannot do,
there is still a small set of rules you must follow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rules panel">
            <div class="column rude">
                <span class="fa-stack fa-lg">
                    <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down fa-stack-1x"></i>
                    <i class="fa fa-ban fa-stack-2x text-danger"></i>
                </span>
                <h2>Never, ever be rude to people.</h2>
                <p>As mentioned before, we aim to create a good experience for the players.

So that means no harrassing people, making fun of them, their skin, their builds, their country, their name, or their religion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column grief-hack">
                <span class="fa-stack fa-lg">
                    <i class="fa fa-warning fa-stack-1x"></i>
                    <i class="fa fa-ban fa-stack-2x text-danger"></i>
                </span>
                <h2>No griefing and hacking.</h2>
                <p>While this usually applies no matter what, we felt we should still state it here.

Destroying other people's builds, contraptions and other things is not okay. Not only will this hurt the people who made the built, since they did all that hard work for nothing, but it will also create fuss and fights, which is something we don't want. If you don't grief and don't hack, then you're welcome!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column steal">
                <span class="fa-stack fa-lg">
                    <i class="fa fa-dollar fa-stack-1x"></i>
                    <i class="fa fa-ban fa-stack-2x text-danger"></i>
                </span>
                <h2>Do not steal.</h2>
                <p>This speaks for itself. No stealing, under no circumstances.

It is not allowed to go up to someone's base and go steal their diamonds or other valuables just so you can be a bit more rich. If you want to borrow/take something from their chests, we advise you ask them beforehand.

To ensure that you've read this, choose the 2nd answer "Yeah" on the "Have you read the rules?" question in your Whitelist Application.</p>

        <div class="apply panel">
            <h2>Wanna apply?</h2>
            <p>We're always on the lookout for bright new spirits to join our awesome community.
So if you think you will fit in nicely, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1f5TDXToK5Boky-KZqqQctIvATqa8c3Y93qdOBWqU_z4/viewform">don't hesitate to apply!</a>
</p>

            <h2>IP</h2>
            <p>If you are accepted and want to connect to the server you're going to need the IP.
            We also recommend you <b><a href="http://www.mumble.com/mumble-download.php">download Mumble.</a></b> It's a voice chat program just like                       TeamSpeak3, that let's you communicate with other players while in-game. If no one's on Mumble, instead of leaving, we ask that you let people know             on Skype to get their butts on Mumble!</p>

            <p>Minecraft IP: <b><a href="minecraft://miningforpotatoes.com:25565">miningforpotatoes.com</a></b><br>
            Mumble IP: <b><a href="mumble://miningforpotatoes.com">miningforpotatoes.com:64738</a></b></p>

            <p>Speaking of Skype, we also highly recommend you <b><a href="http://skype.com/download">download Skype</a></b>, since we have a Skype chat in which we talk about the server, gaming in general, and pretty much anything else. We actually don't just recommend it, we basically require it. A good community member should be active, and if you are unable to do that, you should reconsider the type of server you're looking for.</p>
