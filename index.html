            <h2>Hi, we're Mining for Potatoes, you may remember us from games such as Minecraft, Minecraft and Minecraft...</h2>
            <p>
Thats a lie, you probably have never heard of us... but that doesn't matter. We think thats a good thingâ€“we're just a bunch of friends playing what we want to play with who we want to play. While the aim in the beginning was to play Minecraft, MfP has developed into something more, and we (hopefully) want you to be a part of that...</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>We created Mining for Potatoes about a year ago, but don't let our age fool you. We have members who have played with each other for much longer than that, each with their own quirks and fancies. From the owner, to the mods, to the players, since the beginning, we've aimed to provide the best goddamn server to play, hang out, and just have a blast of a time.</p>

                <h2>Community</h2>
                <p>We love eachother. In the beginning we didn't know eachother. Jack was some guy in New Zealand, Nimit was just a random from USA. Hello, DJ was a girl guy from the Netherlands, and it took us a year to work that out! What we cherish is the community of gamers we have built over time. People have come and gone, but what is left is a group of people who talk about just about anything! Except that guy called Dark. Don't trust him. Kidding, or so you think. ;)</p>

                <h2>Specs</h2>
                <p>The server is ran on a VPS with 2GB of allocated DDR3 RAM. It also has a 100mbps up/down internet connection to ensure you get an as-good-as-possible playing (and being awesome) experience.</p>

            <p>We've gathered pictures of some of the things people have done and built on the server!</p>

                <p>On MfP we have builders and builds in all shapes and sizes.

Some builds are better than others, but then again, when is that not the case? People tend to build huge and amazing bases for all their storage and farming needs! To your right you see only a handful of memorable experiences that can be found on the server. But we promise you, there is more.</p>
